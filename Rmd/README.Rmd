## Shorebird bioenergetics & Central Valley wetland incentives

This repo is for a study of the contribution of wetland incentives programs in the Central Valley (e.g. Bird Returns, WHEP) to shorebird bioenergetics, particularly during both dry and wet years during 2013-2017. The intention is to estimate the contribution of these wetlands to meeting CVJV habitat objectives and shrinking shorebird energy shortfalls during the non-breeding season.


### DATA CHECKLIST:

#### Habitat available & accessible

##### Bird Returns
* IN PROGRESS - Compile annual/seasonal incentive acreages from spatial data (waiting on updated data from partners)
* IN PROGRESS - Overlay spatial data with original CVJV land cover data to check correspondence (waiting on updated data from partners, but mostly rice as expected)
* DONE - Estimate proportion available and accessible by day of year during enrollment
     * Assume 100% open water and 100% accessible during enrollment
     * Do not assume credit for any lingering flooding after enrollment that may occur
* DRAFT - Estimate daily change in BR habitat available, accessible, added, and returned in each year

##### WHEP
* IN PROGRESS - Compile annual/seasonal incentive acreages by program type from Kristin/NRCS data downloads (waiting on potential spatial data)
* If spatial data become available, overlay spatial data with original CVJV land cover data to check correspondence (waiting on potential spatial data)
* DRAFT - Estimate proportion available by day of year during enrollment:
     * Fall flooding: distribute area enrolled over period between 1 July and 15 Sept, assuming two weeks of flooding and two weeks of gradual drawdown
     * Variable drawdown: distribute area enrolled in over 2 weeks in Nov for flood up, and over 4 weeks in Feb for staggered drawdown (with 1/4 of area drawn down during 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks)
     * Boards-in: not included to date
     * Do not assume credit for any lingering flooding after enrollment that may occur
* IN PROGRESS - Estimate proportion accessible by day of year during enrollment:
     * Fall flooding: ?? 100%? 
     * Variable drawdown: Base on rice depth curves plus adjustments from variable drawdown study?

##### Wetlands & crops (potential habitat)
* DONE - Compile annual statewide crop acreages from NASS through 2017, using original CVJV land cover data to estimate total acreage of each crop class within the CVJV primary focus area
* DRAFT - Model proportion open water in each crop class through 2017 using water tracker data
     * Model proportion open water as a function of day of year
     * Try fitting separate models for each year
     * Consider adjusting proportion open water by acreages enrolled in incentive programs? (but probably a tiny %)
     * Predict proportion open water by day of year with confidence intervals for each crop class and year
* DONE - Estimate proportion accessible by day of year, assuming same proportion accessible as original CVJV analysis

##### Compilation across land cover types
* DRAFT - Compile daily estimates of habitat available, accessible, added, and returned in all land cover types in all 4 years


#### Energy density & energy needs
* Assume same energy densities by crop class as in original CVJV analysis
* Assume same population objectives, baseline population size, and daily energy needs as original CVJV analysis
