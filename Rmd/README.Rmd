## Shorebird bioenergetics & Central Valley wetland incentives

This repo is for a study of the contribution of wetland incentives programs in the Central Valley (e.g. Bird Returns, WHEP) to shorebird bioenergetics, particularly during both dry and wet years during 2013-2017. The intention is to estimate the contribution of these wetlands to meeting CVJV habitat objectives and shrinking shorebird energy shortfalls during the non-breeding season.


### CURRENT STATUS: 

Data compilation and processing


### DATA CHECKLIST:

#### Habitat available & accessible

##### Bird Returns
* IN PROGRESS - Compile annual/seasonal incentive acreages from spatial data (waiting on updated data from partners)
* IN PROGRESS - Overlay spatial data with original CVJV land cover data to check correspondence (waiting on updated data from partners, but mostly rice as expected)
* Assume 100% available during enrollment (100% open water)
* Assume 100% accessible during enrollment (100% suitable depth for shorebirds)
* Do not assume credit for any lingering flooding after enrollment that may occur
* Do we care about precipitation?

##### WHEP
* IN PROGRESS - Compile annual/seasonal incentive acreages by program type from Kristin/NRCS data downloads (waiting on potential spatial data)
* If spatial data become available, overlay spatial data with original CVJV land cover data to check correspondence (waiting on potential spatial data)
* Assume 100% available habitat during enrollment? (boards-in only floods with rain?)
* Do not assume 100% accessible during enrollment? Base on rice proportion accessible plus adjustments from variable drawdown study?
* Do we care about precipitation?

##### Wetlands & crops (potential habitat)
* DONE - Compile annual statewide crop acreages from NASS through 2017, using original CVJV land cover data to estimate total acreage of each crop class within the CVJV primary focus area
* Extract proportion open water in each crop class through 2017 using water tracker data (or use time series already on water tracker website?)
* Fit new/updated flooding curves for each crop class including data through 2017
     * Model proportion open water as a function of day of year, accounting for proportion masked by clouds
     * Consider effect of precipitation or annual water year type? (2013-14 = critical; 2014-15 = critical; 2015-16 = dry/below normal; 2016-17 = wet)
     * Consider adjusting proportion open water by acreages enrolled in incentive programs? (but probably a tiny %)
* Predict proportion open water by day of year with confidence intervals for each crop class and year
* Assume same proportion accessible as original CVJV analysis

#### Energy density & energy needs
* Assume same energy densities by crop class as in original CVJV analysis
* Assume same population objectives, baseline population size, and daily energy needs as original CVJV analysis
