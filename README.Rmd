This repository is for a study of the contribution of shorebird habitat incentive programs in the Central Valley (e.g. Bird Returns, WHEP) to shorebird bioenergetics, particularly during both dry and wet years from 2013-14 through 2016-17. The intention is to estimate the contribution of these incentive programs to meeting Central Valley Joint Venture population objectives and reducing shorebird energy shortfalls during the non-breeding season.
